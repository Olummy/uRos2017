### Typical hurdles (2010):

- How to install FOSS? 
- OMG everybody can write CODE now!

- Project with dedicated project leader
- Standardized 3 installation types geared to different user types.
- Set up code/documentation standards

### Currently

- $\pm$ 200 users ($\pm 100$ active)
- One single central installation
- Refer to tidy code/documentation standard

## Support and policy

### Local user group _kennR!_

- Beginner's course & advanced workshops
- User meetings & support
- Functional management

### FOSS Contribution Policy (in short)

- When relevant to statistics Netherlands, with positive business case.

## Packages contributed

## Current infrastructure

- R + RStudio on central folder
    - R-engine usable by non-programmers who just run a script
- RDS server (8core, 64G VM's) for heavier work
