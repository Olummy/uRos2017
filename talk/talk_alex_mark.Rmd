# Statistics Netherlands

## Introducing R


### Typical hurdles (2010):

- How to install FOSS? 
- OMG everybody can write CODE now!

### Approach

- Project with dedicated project leader
- Standardized 3 installation types geared to different user types.
- Set up code/documentation standards

### Currently

- $\pm$ 200 users ($\pm 100$ active)
- One single central installation
- Refer to tidy code/documentation standard

## Support and policy

### Local user group _kennR!_

- Beginner's course & advanced workshops
- User meetings & support
- Functional management

### FOSS Contribution Policy (in short)

- When relevant to statistics Netherlands, with positive business case.

## Packages contributed

## Current infrastructure

- R + RStudio on central folder
    - R-engine usable by non-programmers who just run a script
    - Selection of R packages pre-installed
    - Full CRAN repo available internally (there's no direct internet access from most VM's)
- RDS server (8core, 64G VM's) for heavier work
- Working on connection to Spark server (Sparklyr)
- Looking into RStudio/Shiny server but little/no support experience for
linux currently exists in SN.
